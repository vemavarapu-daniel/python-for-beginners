In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Boolean Type:	bool

You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

example:
a=int(1234) or 1234
b='python'
print(type(a))
print(type(b))

output:
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
